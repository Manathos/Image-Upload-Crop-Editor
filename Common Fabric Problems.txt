The Problem
Fabric.js creates two canvas elements:
Lower canvas - where the actual drawing happens
Upper canvas - where selection handles and interactions happen
The Fix
I added these CSS rules that specifically target Fabric.js canvas elements:
Apply to fabric-simpl...
Why This Fixed It
Before: The original CSS only targeted generic canvas elements, but Fabric.js creates specific canvas elements with classes
After: The new CSS explicitly targets the Fabric.js canvas elements and ensures they're visible with proper styling
The !important declarations override any default Fabric.js styles that might have been hiding the canvas
What Was Happening
Fabric.js was working correctly (as shown by all the console logs)
The canvas elements were being created and objects were being added
But the visual rendering was being blocked by CSS styling conflicts
The lower canvas (where your images/shapes are drawn) wasn't visible due to missing or conflicting CSS
The Lesson
When working with Fabric.js, you need to style both the lower and upper canvas elements specifically, not just generic canvas elements. The lower canvas is where your content appears, and the upper canvas handles interactions.
This is a common gotcha with Fabric.js - the library works perfectly, but the visual output can be hidden by CSS if you don't target the right elements!
